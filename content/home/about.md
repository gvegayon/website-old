# Biography

I'm a Chilean currently spending my days as Research Programmer/Ph.D. Student at USC working on Statistical Computing at the Department of Preventive Medicine with with <a href="https://ipr.usc.edu/faculty.php?faculty_id=46" target="_new">Prof. Thomas W. Valente</a> and <a href="http://keck.usc.edu/faculty/paul-marjoram/" target="_new">Prof. Paul Marjoram</a>. I hold a MA in Economics and Public Policy from <a href="http://www.uai.cl/" target="_blank">Universidad Adolfo Ib치침ez (Chile)</a> and a MS in Social Sciences (aka Economics) from the <a href="http://hss.caltech.edu" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology (USA)</a>. Currently I am interested in policy analysis through (complex) systems modeling, developing (and implementing) new statistical methods for data analysis (and inference), statistical computing, and computational social sciences in general.
