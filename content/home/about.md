# Biography

I'm a Chilean working and getting a Ph.D. at USC on Statistical Computing at the [Department of Preventive Medicine](https://pm.usc.edu) with with <a href="https://www.kayladelahaye.net/" target="_new">Prof. Kayla de la Haye</a> and <a href="http://keck.usc.edu/faculty/paul-marjoram/" target="_new">Prof. Paul Marjoram</a>. I hold a MA in Economics and Public Policy from <a href="http://www.uai.cl/" target="_blank">Universidad Adolfo Ib치침ez (Chile)</a> and a M.Sc. in Economics from the <a href="http://hss.caltech.edu" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology (USA)</a>. Currently, I'm interested in social networks, developing (and implementing) new statistical methods for data analysis (and inference), statistical computing, and computational social sciences in general.
