This talk was the first time I presented my PhD work in full. The talk was an
opportunity that I got from one of my comittee members, Prof. [Emilio Ferrara](http://emilio.ferrara.name/).
The subtitle of the talk has nothing to do with the topic, but I just really like
that movie. You can find the source code of my talk here:
