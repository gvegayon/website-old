abstract = "While the R programming language was not developed for High Performance Computing (think about the ‘for’ loops!), thanks to its alwaysthriving community of users, there are several ways in which R can be used to perform HPC. In this presentation, we will provide a general overview of HPC in R with a particular focus on multicore processing (i.e. no big data for now), and introduce some of the available tools for enhancing your R code. Furthermore, we'll include some examples using the 'parallel' package, the 'foreach'+'iterators' R packages, and Rcpp(Armadillo) + OpenMP. The seminar will be given by George Vega Yon and Garrett Weaver"
