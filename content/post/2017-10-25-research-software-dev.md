Some times I feel like I'm in the wrong place. At least a few times, while talking to scientists, I've realized that people don't think of scientific software the same way I do, this is, as actual research. While I know I'm not a fancy computer/informatics scientist, I do believe that scientific software development is underestimated.

When I was in the visiting day at Caltech, I recall that one of the questions that our host did to us during the visiting day was "what makes you excited about coming to Caltech?" and my response was something like "creating new things with other people!", which in this context is obiously tools! Later on while on grad school I understood that people was not as excited as I was on that. And now a days, that same feeling of misfits has hit me a couple of times while talking to professors and grad students.

The thing is, I still believe scientific software development is science too. While my claim may be a bit biased, since I really love R and "creating things with other people", I know that I'm not alone (see for example []). A couple of arguments:

1.  Theory is very important, yes, but in order to be useful it has to be available to apply/make use of it in some fashion. This is particlarly relevant for statistics/economics. Now a days, with all the computing power at the tip of our hands there's no excuse for researchers to create tools that make whatever they are doing available.

2.  Writing scientific software helps theory advance. Imagine the following scenario: a fancy new method/model is developed and published in a fancy journal, then
