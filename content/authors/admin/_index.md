I'm a Chilean working and getting a Ph.D. at USC on Biostatistics at the [Department of Preventive Medicine](https://pm.usc.edu) with <a href="https://www.kayladelahaye.net/" target="_new">Prof. Kayla de la Haye</a> and <a href="http://keck.usc.edu/faculty/paul-marjoram/" target="_new">Prof. Paul Marjoram</a>. I'm interested in computational statistics and scientific software development. Most recently, my research has focused on the development of statistical methods for both phylogenetics and social network analysis. You can take a look at my résumé [here](resume.pdf).
