      <description>Parallel lets you run Stata faster, sometimes faster than MP itself. By organizing your job in several Stata instances, parallel allows you to work with out-of-the-box parallel computing. Using the the parallel prefix, you can get faster simulations, bootstrapping, reshaping big data, etc. without having to know a thing about parallel computing. With no need of having Stata/MP installed on your computer, parallel has showed to dramatically speedup computations up to two, four, or more times depending on how many processors your computer has.</description>

      <description>The aphylo R package implements a phylogenetic model for gene functional prediction that I have been developing as part of my doctoral disertation. The package includes functions for estimating these models including calculating probabilities of functional annotations on unannorated genes. This is part of a larger project on development of methods for Integrative Methods for Analysis of Genetic and Epidemiological Data (IMAGE) at USC.

      <description>Empirical statistical analysis, visualization and simulation of diffusion and contagion processes on networks. The package implements algorithms for calculating network diffusion statistics such as transmission rate, hazard rates, exposure models, network threshold levels, infectiousness (contagion), and susceptibility. The package is inspired by work published in Valente, et al., (2015) DOI:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.10.001; Valente (1995) ISBN:9781881303213, Myers (2000) DOI:10.1086&amp;frasl;303110, Iyengar and others (2011) DOI:10.1287/mksc.1100.0566, Burt (1987) DOI:10.1086&amp;frasl;228667; among others.
