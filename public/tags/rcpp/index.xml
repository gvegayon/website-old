      <description>Working with sparse matrices is a big part of my day. Social networks are inherently sparse, so sparse matrices are the best buds you can get when representing large networks as adjacency matrices.1 As so, I usually find myself trying to take advantage of their structure as, contrasting dense matrices, we donâ€™t need to write nested for(i...) for (j...) loops to work with them, instead, sometimes all what we want is just to extract/work with its non-zero elements.</description>

      <title>Setting up optional OpenMP support with RcppArmadillo</title>

      <description>Setting up an R package that supports OpenMP can be a bit awkward. While systems like Ubuntu with g++ have straight forward support for -fopenmp flags, the same may not be true un MacOS&amp;rsquo;s clang, since the latter is not shipped with it.
In order to solve this, it is necesary to have different src/Makevars file depending on whether the compiler supports OpenMP or not. This can be solved using a configure file, more over, autoconf.</description>
