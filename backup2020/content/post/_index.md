As you'll quickly find out, I enjoy writing about R/Stats/Computing overall :). Here you'll find some staff that I've wrote mostly with the motivation practice writing and also as a way of documenting stuff that I find useful. Most of this will be posted on [r-bloggers.com](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).
