abstract = "There has been a long history of studying the diffusion and adoption of policies by governments, and some of these studies explicitly use network data. This research has resulted in both theoretical and methodological advances in understanding the governance process. In this paper, we further contribute to this literature by analyzing the implementation of a public health treaty by national governments using a diffusion of innovations perspective. The central thesis of this article is that national policy implementation is in part a function of the implementation activities of other nations the focal nation is connected to. The treaty studied here is the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)."
